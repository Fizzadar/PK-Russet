#PK Russet
PK Russet is my attempt to re-create Pokemon in Javascript. It runs in the browser and also can be run under Node to enable multiplayer servers.

##Clientside

+ Movement and switching between maps
+ Manage team of Pokemon (edit moves, use items etc)
+ Battling wild pokemon
+ Code to talk to server for networked map/chat


##Serverside

+ Networked movement and chat dependant on a users map
